# Old Resume Website

LIVE DEMO: https://tjzimmerman.com/old

This repository contains the source code for an old personal website. It is principly written in HTML and CSS

This website was made while learning about Apache to have an internet-facing home server.

On this website, you'll find information about me as well as links (probably no longer working) to some of my servers and online presences.
