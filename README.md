#Old Resume Website

LIVE DEMO: https://tjzimmerman.com/old

This repository contains the source code for my old personal website. It is principly written in HTML and CSS

I made this website while learning about Apache to have an internet-facing home server.

On this website, you'll find information about me as well as links (probably no longer working) to some of my servers and online presences.
